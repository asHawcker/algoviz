# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application for visualizing fundamental computer science algorithms.

## Purpose

This project is an educational tool designed to make learning algorithms easier and more intuitive. By watching algorithms in action, users can gain a deeper understanding of how they work. It's perfect for students, developers, and anyone curious about programming.

## Key Features

*   **Visual Animations:** Watch algorithms sort and search data step-by-step.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Play, pause, and step through the process at your own pace.
*   **Adjustable Speed:** Slow down the animation to see every detail or speed it up for a quick overview.
*   **Customizable Data:** Change the size of the array to see how algorithms perform on different datasets.
*   **Clear Status Updates:** A message panel explains what the algorithm is doing at each step.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Sorting
*   Bubble Sort
*   Quick Sort
*   Merge Sort
*   3-Way Merge Sort

### Searching
*   Linear Search
*   Binary Search

## How to Use

1.  Select an algorithm from the sidebar on the left.
2.  Use the controls at the top to generate a new array, change its size, or adjust the speed.
3.  Click "Play" to watch the animation or "Next Step" to advance one step at a time.
